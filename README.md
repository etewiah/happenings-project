== Welcome to the Happenings Project

The idea behind the Happenings Project is to make it easy to share information about happenings ( events such as concerts, sports competitions ).  

I am starting off with the simplest solution possible - an API server to which happenings can be posted and which serves happenings in the JSON format.  The first iteration will be based on my naive assumptions about what a happening should contain and how it should be stored and retrieved.  I know I will make many mistakes here so I want to invite contributions from the community from the start.  Please let me know what I am doing wrong and help me to improve.

My long term vision is that many people will host instances of this API server and people wishing to develop apps that need data about happenings can easily obtain it.  I envision that I will eventually need to figure out some way of enabling server to server information exchange to propagate happenings.  I really don't know right now how I will implement that but I am looking forward to the challenge.  

I will update the progress of this project on the [wiki](https://github.com/etewiah/happenings-project/wiki/_pages).  I will also post ocassional random thoughts like [this](http://redemptionthongs.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/making-events-easier-to-discover-on-the-internet/) on my blog.

An example happenings project server will be hosted here [http://happenings-project.herokuapp.com](http://happenings-project.herokuapp.com)
